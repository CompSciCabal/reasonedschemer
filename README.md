# The Reasoned Schemer

This repo contains the exercises worked through by the CS Cabal during our
read-through of The Reasoned Schemer.

The exercises are done in [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) using the [`core.logic`](https://github.com/clojure/core.logic) library.

To play along:

* Install Clojure
* Check out this repo
* Run `clj -X:clerk`

The last command will start a [Clerk](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk) notebook and launch you browser pointing to
it.  Editing and saving one of the files under `notebooks` will cause that
notebook to be shown in the browser.
